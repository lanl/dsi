=============
DSI
=============

The goal of the Data Science Infrastructure Project (DSI) is to provide a flexible, 
AI-ready metadata query capability which returns data subject to strict, POSIX-enforced file security. 
The data lifecycle for AI/ML requires seamless transitions from data-intensive/AI/ML research activity to long-term archiving and shared data repositories. 
DSI enables flexible, data-intensive scientific workflows that meet researcher needs.

DSI is implemented in three parts:

* Readers and Writers
* Backends 
* Core middleware

For more information on these DSI modules, please refer to the `DSI Introduction Page <https://lanl.github.io/dsi/intro-users.html>`_.

Users can interact with DSI seamlessly through two methods:

* `Python API <https://lanl.github.io/dsi/python_api.html>`_ for more flexibility when loading/exporting data
* `Command Line Interface API <https://lanl.github.io/dsi/cli_api.html>`_ for streamlined DSI functionality without requiring any knowledge of Python


========================
DSI Base Requirements
========================
* python3 (3.11 tested)
* Cross-platform (Unix / macOS / Windows)
* Git
* Plugins and Backends introduce further requirements

===============
Installation
===============

DSI has several versioned releases and cloning from 'main' is the alpha-version. 

Users that want to install DSI should follow our `installation steps <https://lanl.github.io/dsi/installation.html>`_.
	
=====================
Release Versions
=====================

Supported release versions of DSI are tagged and found in (https://github.com/lanl/dsi/releases). Releases with minimal requirements are published on *pip* via (https://pypi.org/project/dsi-workflow/). To install the latest version, try the following::

	python3 -m pip install dsi-workflow

=====================
Contributor Resources
=====================
DSI Contributors can view our more developer-focused documentation in the `Contributor Resources <https://lanl.github.io/dsi/contributors.html>`_.

These pages further explain DSI Readers/Writers/Backends, as well as how to write your own Reader/Writer compatible with DSI.
Project contributors are encouraged to prototype solutions which do not contain sensitive data at this time.
